        <p>
          By the end of the ninth century there were large-scale settlements of
          Scandinavians in various parts of Britain, and they had achieved
          political domination over a significant territory. Early in the 11th
          century the king of Denmark became king of England as well. And in
          1066 there were separate invasions by the king of Norway, Harald
          Hardrada, and duke of Normandy, William, the latter the descendant of
          Scandinavian settlers in northern France.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet the most significant development of the period was an indirect
          result of Scandinavian involvement in the affairs of Britain - the
          emergence of two kingdoms of newly unified territories, England and
          Scotland.In 793 AD, an anguished Alcuin of York wrote to the Higbald,
          the bishop of Lindisfarne and to Ethelred, King of Northumbria,
          bemoaning the unexpected attack on the monastery of Lindisfarne by
          Viking raiders, probably Norwegians sailing directly across the North
          Sea to Northumbria.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is clear from the letter that Lindisfarne was not destroyed. Alcuin
          suggested that further attack might be averted by moral reform in the
          monastery. Over the next few decades, many monasteries in the north
          were destroyed, and with them any records they might have kept of the
          raids. We know no historical details of the raids in Scotland,
          although they must have been extensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iona was burnt in 802 AD, and 68 monks were killed in another raid in
          806 AD. The remaining monks fled to Kells (County Meath, Ireland) with
          a gospel-book probably produced in Iona, but now known as the 'Book of
          Kells'.Other monasteries in Scotland and northern England simply
          disappear from the record. Lindisfarne was abandoned, and the monks
          trailed around northern England with their greatest possession, the
          relics of St Cuthbert, until they found a home in Durham in 995 AD.
