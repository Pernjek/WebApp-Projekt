        The Vikings came from the rugged, inhospitable north known today as
        Scandinavia. As the Roman Empire flourished further south, Scandinavians
        had small settlements, no central government, and no coinage. Yet by the
        11th century, the Vikings had spread far from Scandinavia, gaining
        control of trade routes throughout Europe, conquering kingdoms as far as
        Africa, and even building outposts in North America. The secret to their
        success was their ships.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formidable Viking longship had its origins in the humble dugout
        canoe, or log boat. For millennia, the inhabitants of Scandinavia had
        used these canoes for transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
        . Dense forests and tall mountains made overland travel difficult, but
        long coastlines and numerous rivers, lakes, and fjords provided a viable
        alternative. The first canoes were simply hollowed out logs rowed with
        paddles. Over time, they added planks to the log boat base using the
        clinker, or "lapstrake," technique, meaning the planks overlapped and
        were fastened to each other along their edges.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Roman Empire expanded north, some Scandinavians served in their
        new neighbors’ armies— and brought home Roman maritime technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mediterranean cultures at the heart of the Roman Empire had large
        warships that controlled the sea, and cargo ships that transported goods
        along the waterways. These ships were powered by sail and oars and
        relied on a strong skeleton of internal timbers fastened to the outer
        planks with copper, iron, and wood nails. At first, Scandinavians
        incorporated this new technology by replacing their loose paddles with
        anchored oars. This change hugely improved the crew’s efficiency, but
        also required stronger ships.
      </p>
      <p>
        So boat builders began to use iron nails for fasteners rather than
        sewing. They abandoned the log boat base for a keel plank, and the boats
        became higher and more seaworthy. But these early ships retained the
        concept of the original log boat: their strength depended on the outer
        shell of wood, not internal frames and beams. They were built as shells—
        thin-walled but strong, and much lighter than the Roman ships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Competing chieftains quickly refined the new ships to be even more
        efficient.
